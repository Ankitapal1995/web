<h3>TB-AMRpred: AI/ML-Based Drug Resistance Prediction</h3>

<p>
An AI/ML-based model was designed using whole genome sequencing data without relying on any known drug resistance biomarkers to predict resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> for 13 drugs. Explainable AI was integrated to identify both known and novel resistance-associated biomarkers. The model was validated on an independent test dataset, achieving high sensitivity (90%–95%) and specificity (94%–99%).

<h3>Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis of Drug Resistance Biomarkers in Breast Cancer</h3>

<p>
This project identified cell type-specific biomarkers for drug resistance in breast cancer using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. A total of 40 human breast cancer samples (20 erlotinib-resistant and 20 susceptible) were analyzed to reveal gene expression signatures and enriched pathways linked to drug response and resistance.

<h3>DraVAR: Variant Annotation & Resistance Biomarker Discovery</h3>

<p>
DraVAR is a Nextflow-based pipeline, implemented in Bash, for analyzing whole genome sequencing data to identify variants associated with drug resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. It integrates established tools for quality control (FastQC, Trimmomatic), alignment (BWA-MEM), variant calling (Samtools, bcftools), and annotation (SnpEff). Using WHO-recommended statistical methods, mutations are graded by confidence levels (high, moderate, low association) based on prevalence and functional impact. The pipeline achieves over 80% accuracy against the gold standard mutation catalogues

<h3>OncoVAR: Cancer-Specific Somatic Variant Detection</h3>

<p>
OncoVAR is a custom pipeline for detecting cancer-specific somatic mutations from matched tumor-normal NGS data. It employs samtools and bcftools for variant calling, benchmarks against Mutect2 and VarScan2, and validates findings using a reference gene list to ensure accurate identification of tumor-exclusive mutations. Notably, OncoVAR identified additional mutations in EGFR, CDKN2A, TP53, and MED12 genes missed by Mutect2 and VarScan2, demonstrating enhanced sensitivity in mutation detection.

<h3>InTGS: Tuberculosis Genomic Surveillance Platform</h3>

<p>
A genomic pipeline was developed to predict antibiotic resistance from tuberculosis patient samples. It was deployed as part of the Indian Tuberculosis Genomic Surveillance Consortium (InTGS), an initiative of the Indian government that collaborates with 10 prominent Indian institutes. The pipeline analyzes drug resistance variants in Indian TB patients to support India's TB-free goals.

<h3>MutMapTB: Structure-Guided Mutation Interpretation</h3>

<p>
In silico functional analysis was conducted on newly discovered mutations associated with antitubercular drug resistance. The mechanistic basis of resistance was examined by mapping mutations onto 3D structures of key drug targets, measuring their proximity to drug binding sites, and comparing their abundance in drug-resistant versus susceptible <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains. A database was established to store mutation abundance data from resistant and susceptible isolates, along with their structural information.

<h3>Type 1 Diabetes Methylation Biomarker Discovery</h3>

<p>
NGS bisulfite sequencing and microarray data were analyzed to identify CpG site methylation patterns associated with Type 1 diabetes detection. Clinical cohort data from American and Chinese patients were examined using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods to discover methylation-based biomarkers for Type 1 diabetes.

<h3>Bulk RNA, Spatial Transcriptomics, and Metabolomics Integration</h3>

<p>
Bulk RNA analysis was performed on sarcoma and healthy samples. Spatial transcriptomics analysis using Squidpy and metabolomics analysis using in-house scripts and MetaboAnalyst were conducted to validate metadata curation for client deliverables.
